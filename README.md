# Movie-Management-Systems

The project combines several powerful data structures—Trie, Max Heap (Priority Queue), AVL Tree, Segment Tree, and Graphs—to efficiently manage and process information within a movie database system. It provides an interactive, menu-driven interface where users can:

Search and autocomplete movie titles or genres using a Trie, enabling fast prefix-based lookups for user convenience and responsive search experiences.

Manage movie ratings with an AVL Tree that sorts and retrieves movies by their average ratings, allowing for efficient ascending, descending, and filtered queries on ratings.

Perform range queries and updates on numerical data using a Segment Tree, supporting rapid calculations and updates—useful for analytics and statistical features.

Explore relationships between movies or users through graphs, offering BFS and DFS traversals for connectivity analysis and network-based queries.

Track user watchlists using a dedicated class, enabling personalized movie recommendations and history management
